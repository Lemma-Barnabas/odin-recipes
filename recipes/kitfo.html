    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Kitfo (Amharic: ክትፎ, IPA: [kɨtfo]), is an Ethiopian traditional dish which originated among the Gurage people. It consists of minced raw beef, marinated in mitmita (a chili powder-based spice blend) and niter kibbeh (a clarified butter infused with herbs and spices).</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs top round beef (freshly cut)</li>
        <li>6 teaspoons ground cayenne pepper (Mitmita*)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons clarified butter (Nitir Kebe)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cardamom powder (korerima)</li>
        <li>1⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the meat in small pieces; remove fat and seams.</li>
        <li>In a food processor put small amount of the meat at a time, spread some mitmita, grind until meat is finely chopped; using a fork, remove any residue of fat and seams; place the spicy ground meat in a dish; repeat the process until all required meat is done.</li>
        <li>In small pot, on a lower heat melt the butter, add the remaining mitmita, false cardamom, (garlic, black pepper, salt, if needed); remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Combine the spicy ground meat with the spicy butter; using fork and spoon, mix it until completely marinated.</li>
        <li>Place it in a lightly warm serving dish, serve it immediately with Injera or bread. If preferred, sauté the marinated meat for two to three minutes.</li>
        <li>Note: As Steak Tartar is uncooked dish, choice of first class quality meat and cleanliness is important.</li>
