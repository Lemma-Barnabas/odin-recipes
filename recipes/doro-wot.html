    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Crown Jewel of Ethiopian Cuisine Doro Wot (Direct translation from Amharic - the language spoken in Ethiopian) Doro wot literally means “chicken stew.” The word doro stands for chicken, and wot means stew. It’s hard to say if doro wot is officially Ethiopia’s national dish, but it’s certainly one of the most popular, both to Ethiopians and to Westerners. As far as I can remember Doro Wot has been around as one of the Main Ethiopian Cuisine. And it’s often the “Special” meal, always served at occasions such us Holidays, Weddings, or any Special occasion it may be celebrated. </p>
